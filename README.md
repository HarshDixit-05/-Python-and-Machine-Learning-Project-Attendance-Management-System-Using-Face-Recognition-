# 📌 Attendance Management System (Face Detection Based)
## 📖 Overview

The Attendance Management System is an AI-powered solution that uses Face Detection technology to automate attendance marking.
Instead of traditional manual methods, this system captures student/employee faces, verifies them against the database, and marks attendance automatically.

This project was created as part of our academic/college project to explore the applications of AI, Computer Vision, and Database Management.

## 🚀 Features

🔹 Face Detection & Recognition using OpenCV.

🔹 Automatic Attendance Marking (reduces manual effort & errors).

🔹 Database Integration for storing student/employee details.

🔹 Date & Time Logging for every attendance entry.

🔹 CSV/Excel Export of attendance reports.

🔹 User-Friendly GUI for managing records.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

Programming Language: Python / Java (depending on your project)

Libraries: OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas

Database: MySQL / SQLite

Tools/Frameworks: Tkinter / JavaFX (if UI present)

Version Control: Git & GitHub

cd attendance-management-system


Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


Run the project:

python main.py

## 📸 How It Works

Register Users → Capture face data & save it in the database.

Train Model → Generate trained data using OpenCV.

Mark Attendance → Recognize faces in real-time and log attendance.

Export Report → Save attendance in CSV/Excel format.

## 📊 Use Cases

🎓 Schools & Colleges – Student attendance automation.

🏢 Offices – Employee check-in & check-out system.

🎯 Events – Quick participant verification.

📌 Future Improvements

🔹 Cloud integration for remote access.

🔹 Mobile app for teachers/admins.

🔹 Multi-camera support.

🔹 Integration with biometric/fingerprint systems.
