The Attendance Management System (Using Face Recognition)

The Attendance Management System Using Face Recognition is an advanced Python and Machine Learning project that automates attendance marking by identifying individuals through facial recognition. It utilizes NumPy for numerical operations, PyTorch and TensorFlow for deep learning model development, and OpenCV for real-time facial detection and processing. The system ensures accurate, efficient, and secure attendance tracking, reducing manual errors and saving time.
